# KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Project

_Please be patient as this is an in-progress project._

My mentorship project explores the use of ChatGPT, prompt engineering, and prompt chaining in determining whether a news article is fake or real news. 

__Dataset:__ [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

There are 3 phases to this project:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Stylometric Analysis
2. LLM Differentiation of Real and Fake News
3. Fact Identification and Fact-Checking with ChatGPT and LangChain

There was also a stretch goal analysis of comparing GPT 3.5 to GPT 4.
