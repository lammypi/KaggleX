# KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Project

_Please be patient as this is an in-progress project. My mentorship runs until December 14, 2023._

My mentorship project explores the use of prompt engineering in determining whether a news article is fake or real news. At this early stage, the planned phases include:
- Evaluating ChatGPT as a tool for fact-checking via zero shot classification and zero shot chain-of-thought classification.

Then, I will evaluate how well the model performs this classification via accuracy, f1 scores, and confusion matrices. 
- If there is enough time, I will be building a model that looks at specific stylometric measures to predict whether an article is fake or real, and comparing that to the outputs of each LLM.
